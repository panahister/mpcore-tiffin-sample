/// <para>
/// Without this factory, <c>dotnet ef</c> constructs the host and resolves the context from the
/// <b>root</b> service provider, together with everything the run-time composition attaches to it: the
/// message bus, and the interceptors of business audit, request idempotency and the inbox. The tools
/// then stop before any migration is read, for example at <i>"Cannot resolve scoped service ... from
/// root provider"</i>. The composition is correct at run time, so the design-time path has a context of
/// its own instead of a weaker run-time registration.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is generated for every backend, whatever was chosen: a capability that attaches an interceptor can
/// be added later, and the way a migration is written should not change on that day.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The context returned here has no interceptor and no message bus, and needs neither. A migration
/// needs the model, and the tables of a capability are part of the model through its
/// <c>Apply...</c> call in <c>AppDbContext.OnModelCreating</c>. An interceptor writes rows, which a
/// migration never does.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The connection string is read from the environment and never from <c>appsettings.json</c>, whose
/// generated value is a placeholder. A migration must name the database it is applied to
